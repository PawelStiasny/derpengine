A small shader-based OpenGL scene graph engine.

Features
========
* Extensible scene graph
* Dynamic shadow maps
* (Static) environment maps
* Bumpmapping of unparametrized meshes
* Heightmap based terrain

Dependencies
============
Compile time:
* SCons
* gcc or clang on Linux, MSVC compiler on Windows
* glm

Run time:
* OpenGL 3.0, forward compatible with current version 4.3
* glew
* SDL 2.0 (development version)

Compiling
=========
Build process is handled by SCons both on Windows and Linux.

On Linux, just execute `scons` in project's root.  Append `debug=1` to build
with debug symbols and optimizations disabled.  Dependencies should be installed
in system-wide default paths.

On Windows, you can drop dependencies in the `external` subdirectory.
Unless you have Python set in your PATH, the build command will be something
like

    C:\Python27\scons.bat
